 #CODECHALLENGES
 
 1) Declare Enum that conforms to Error. Your enum should have at least 5 cases and should use Associated Values.
 
 2) Declare a Person class with 3 member properties. Declare a Student subclass that inherits from Person.
        -> Both Your Student and Person class should have a variety of meaningful Type and Instance Methods. Be creative.
        -> In either of these 2 classes, demonstrate a computed property and implement a property observer.
 
 3) Create a Classroom class that is a true singleton and has an array of Students.
        -> Add accessor methods to Classroom to add and remove from the array.
